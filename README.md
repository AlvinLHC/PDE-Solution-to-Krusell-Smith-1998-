# PDE Solution to Krusell-Smith (1998)

This is a Matlab program which uses **Finite-Difference Method** to solve the Krusell Smith (1998) model. Krusell-Smith (1998) proposed a 
multiple-agent model with uninsurable idiosyncratic income shocks and aggregate shock.

```math
V(k_t, z_t) = \max_{c_t} \{u(c_t) + \beta \mathbb{E}[V(k_{t+1}, z_{t+1}) ]\}
```
